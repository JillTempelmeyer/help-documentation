# Getting Started with Box Panel

The Box Panel interface provides a single, consolidated view of enterprise assets deployed in your Blue Box Dedicated and Local environments. Based on OpenStack Horizon, its self-service access lets users create support tickets, leverage central authentication, monitor reporting functions, and view their invoicing solutions, easily. 

This user guide provides an end-to-end overview to help you get started using Box Panel Version 3.8.3 and later, so you can monitor and control your IBM Blue Box Cloud. 

## Logging In 

To get started with Box Panel, log in. 

**To log into your Box Panel Account:**

1. Click the following URL to be directed to the login page: https://boxpanel.bluebox.net.
2. Log into your Box Panel account with the login credentials provided by the Blue Box Support Team. If you are a **Secondary** contact and don't yet have access, you can be added by an **Administrator**. See the **Managing Users and Projects** section for more details.
3. If you do not yet have a Box Panel account, refer to the **Billing** section to set up an account.
5. After logging in, you will be directed automatically to the Box Panel Dashboard UI.

## Using Lock Box to Log In

You will receive your `cloud_admin` credentials to your private OpenStack cluster through the Box Panel Lock Box. Your credentials should look like this:

{% highlight bash %} URL: https://customer_name.openstack.blueboxgrid.com User name: **Specified Username** Password: **Specified Password** {% endhighlight %}

Navigate to the above URL. You can then use your **Specified Username** and **Specified Password** to log in.

## Navigating the Box Panel Dashboard

From the Box Panel Dashboard, you can see a consolidated asset view of all of your Blue Box Dedicated and Local instances on one screen.

The top of the Dashboard displays the infrastructure currently in use, with your list of hosts. 

![Image of Dashboard1](https://github.com/help-documentation/img/Dashboard1.png)

Immediately below, you can view your bandwidth usage and any support tickets related to your cloud, along with your status. 

![Image of Dashboard 2](https://github.com/help-documentation/img/Dashboard 2.png)

On the right, additional details related to your account summary, including your **Lock Box Messages**, **Verbal Password**, **Bandwidth Quota**, and **Backup Quota** are displayed.

## Managing Users and Projects

Version 3 of the Keystone API with IBM Blue Box Cloud introduces the concept of **groups**. You can use groups to make multiple assignments simultaneously. For more information on Keystone v3, **groups**, **projects**, **users**, and use cases, please refer to the primary document on this topic: [Managing Users and Projects] (http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/Managing_Users_and_Projects/)

## Creating a Project

As shown in the **Managing Users and Projects** document, only users with `cloud_admin` roles can create projects and users.

**To create a project:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab, then click **Projects**
2. Click the **Create Project** button.
3. Assign a **Project Name** and **Description** under the **Project Information** tab shown in the Modal window.
4. Assign **Users** to your project by clicking the search bar in the **Project Members** tab. Users can be added and deleted later.
5. Enter resource allocation information under the **Quotas** tab to set and customize quotas for your new project.
6. Click the **Create Project** button.

To add or delete a user, click the **Modify Users** drop-down under the **Actions** section.

**To create a new user:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab.
2. Click **Create User**.
3. Enter a user name and their email address in the Modal window.

7. Confirm that you would like to create the user by clicking the **Create User** button.

## Disabling a Project

**Consequences of disabling projects:**
Users with the `cloud_admin` role can enable and disable projects. When you disable a project, it has these consequences:

- In the dashboard, users no longer have access to the project from the CURRENT PROJECT list on the Project tab.
- Users who are members of only the disabled project can no longer log in.
- You cannot launch instances for a disabled project. Instances that are running already are not terminated automatically. You must stop them manually.
- The data for a disabled project is maintained so that you can re-enable the project at any time.

**To disable a project:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab.
2. Click **Projects**.
3. Check each box associated with the project(s) you would like to disable.
4. Confirm that you would like to disable the project by clicking the **Disable Projects** button.

## Creating a Custom Flavor

In OpenStack, a **Flavor** is a template for describing the resource configuration of a Virtual Machine.

**To create a Custom Flavor:**

1. From the **Project** menu, click the **System** drop-down.
2. Click **Flavors**. Here you will see a list of your current **Flavors**.
3. Click the **Create Flavor** button.
4. Enter a name and assign custom configuration information.

**To add an asset or machine:**

1. From the **Project** menu, select **Instances**.
2. Click the **Launch Instance** button.
3. Enter an **Instance Name** in the Modal window.
4. Assign an **Instance Flavor** from the options in the drop-down menu. You can view **Flavor Details** when you select your option to receive feedback on whether you have enough quota to allow this machine to be built. If the **Instance Flavor** exceeds your consumption quota, you'll be notified before your instance is created.
5. Select a **Boot Source**.
6. Under the **Access and Security** tab, enter autentication information.
7. Under the **Networking** tab, assign your machine to your **Selected Networks**. Your **Available Networks** will be shown in the drop-down menu.
8. Click **Launch Instance**.

On the **Instances** page, find your machine in the list and select the **Actions** drop-down menu to manage your machine.

## Deleting a Virtual Machine

**To delete an asset or machine:** 

1. Visit the **Instances** page. 
2. As long as you have the proper permissions to delete an asset, you can **Power Cycle** the machineâ€™s PDUs, or select **Delete Asset.** 
3. Confirm that you want to delete the asset by clicking **OK** from the Modal window. Your asset will be deleted permanently.

**To chat with Blue Box Support**:

1. Click the **Chat** tab from your Dashboard. This automatically directs you to a chat room with support staff. 
2. From here, you are able to view the support staff members join your conversation on the left-hand side of the chat room.

4. If you need to escalate your support issue, please call 1-800-613-4305 ext 1.

**Note: Each customer chat room is private. This means that only contacts within your customer account and Blue Box staff have access. No sensitive data (credit card numbers, private keys) is persisted.**

## Managing Billing 

To view your contracts and monthly billing reports, simply click the **Account** tab in the Box Panel Dashboard, then click the **Billing** tab.

**To become a new customer:**

1. Provide the Blue Box Support team with the billing managerâ€™s name, email, and other contact information associated with your company.
2. After your companyâ€™s billing information is received by the IBM Finance, a contract is created based on your requirements. Every IBM customer has a CFTS (customer fulfillment) account assigned. This information is documented and written on your contract. 
3. A billing start date will be set so that your solution can begin to be billed (typically, the start date is the same as your deployment date, and billing repeats monthly).

Once youâ€™re able to log into Box Panel, you can view your billing information by selecting **Billing** under the **Account** drop-down menu. From here, you can view your **Account Services** and **Billing History**.

By clicking **Billing History**, you can download all of your invoices and save them in PDF format.

For further billing support, please contact the Blue Box Support Team, and we will be happy to assist you.
To add additional line items, such as expansion nodes, to your infrastructure, please contact the Blue Box Support Team. We will create a new monthly contract and help to streamline your setup process in any way that we can.
