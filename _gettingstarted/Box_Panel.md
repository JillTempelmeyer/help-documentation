# Getting Started with Box Panel

The Box Panel interface provides a single, consolidated view of enterprise assets deployed in your Blue Box Dedicated and Local environments. Based on OpenStack Horizon, its self-service access lets users create support tickets, leverage central authentication, monitor reporting functions, and view their invoicing solutions, easily. 

This user guide provides an end-to-end overview to help you get started using Box Panel Version 3.8.3 and later, so you can monitor and control your IBM Blue Box Cloud. 

## Logging In 

To get started with Box Panel, log in. 

**Logging into your Box Panel Account:**

1. Click the following URL to be directed to the login page: https://boxpanel.bluebox.net.
2. Log into your Box Panel account with the login credentials provided by the Blue Box Support Team. If you are a **Secondary** contact and don't yet have access, you can be added by an **Administrator**. See the **Managing Users and Projects** section for more details.
3. If you do not yet have a Box Panel account, refer to the **Billing** section to set up an account.
5. After logging in, you will be directed automatically to the Box Panel Dashboard UI.

## Using Lock Box to Log In
+
+You will receive your `cloud_admin` credentials to your private OpenStack cluster through the Box Panel Lock Box. Your credentials should look like this:
+
+{% highlight bash %}

URL: https://customer_name.openstack.blueboxgrid.com 

User name: **Your Specified Username**

Password: **Your Specified Password**

{% endhighlight %}
+
+Navigate to the above URL. You can then use **Your Specified Username** and ** Your Specified Password** to log in.


## Navigating the Box Panel Dashboard

From the Box Panel Dashboard, you can see a consolidated asset view of all of your Blue Box Dedicated and Local instances on one screen.

The top of the Dashboard displays the infrastructure currently in use, with your list of hosts. 

![Image of Dashboard 1](https://github.com/help-documentation/img/Dashboard1.png)

Immediately below, you can view your bandwidth usage and any support tickets related to your cloud, along with your status. 

![Image of Dashboard 2](https://github.com/help-documentation/img/Dashboard 2.png)

On the right, additional details related to your account summary are displayed. 

## Managing Users and Projects

A **Project** is a group of resources that can be asssigned to a user or a group of users.

**Users** include the following four predefined roles: **cloud_admin**, **project_admin**, **\_member\_**, and **heat_stack_owner**. A fifth role, **heat_stack_user**, is assigned automatically. 

Version 3 of the Keystone API with IBM Blue Box Cloud introduces the concept of **groups**. You can use groups to make multiple assignments simultaneously. For more information on Keystone v3, **groups**, and use cases, please refer to the primary document on this topic: [Managing Users and Projects] (http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/keystone/Managing_Users_and_Projects/)

## Creating a Project

As shown in the **Managing Users and Projects** document, only users with `cloud_admin` roles can create projects and users.

**To create a project:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab, then click **Projects**
2. Click the **Create Project** button.
3. Assign a **Project Name** and **Description** under the **Project Information** tab shown in the Modal window.
4. Assign **Users** to your project by clicking the search bar in the **Project Members** tab. Users can be added and deleted later.
5. Enter resource allocation information under the **Quotas** tab to set and customize quotas for your new project.
6. Click the **Create Project** button.

To add or delete a user, click the **Modify Users** drop-down under the **Actions** section.

**To create a new user:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab.
2. Click **Create User**.
3. Enter a user name and their email address in the Modal window.

## Disabling a Project

**Consequences of disabling projects:**
Users with the `cloud_admin` role can enable and disable projects. When you disable a project, it has these consequences:

- In the dashboard, users no longer have access to the project from the CURRENT PROJECT list on the Project tab.
- Users who are members of only the disabled project can no longer log in.
- You cannot launch instances for a disabled project. Instances that are running already are not terminated automatically. You must stop them manually.
- The data for a disabled project is maintained so that you can re-enable the project at any time.

**To disable a project:**

1. Click the **Identity** tab.
2. Click **Projects**.
3. Check each box associated with the project(s) you would like to disable.
4. Confirm that you would like to disable the project by clicking the **Disable Projects** button.

 9. If you wish to open your ticket as **Urgent** and consent to pay the consulting charges for non-critical items, check the **I Agree** box. 
 10. Finally, click the **Create Ticket** box. 

**Using Your Support Ticket

Anytime after a ticket is created, you can see the text associated with that ticket, by clicking on that support ticket from the Dashboard. The text may include references to other tickets, as well as chat history and correspondence related to the selected ticket. The status of the support ticket is highlighted on the orange button in the top left corner. 

![Image of Dashboard 6](https://github.com/help-documentation/img/Dashboard 6.png) 

From the panel on the left-hand side of the screen, you can select options to create another new support ticket, subscribe to the ticket you have selected (if you want to follow its status), view your tickets, and view all tickets submitted by shared users on your account. 

To view a list of Subscribers for a selected ticket, click on the **Subscribers** link.

To have a written conversation with one of our Blue Box support team experts about the topic of this ticket, you can click the green **Post Reply** button, or you can use the live **Chat** feature by clicking on **Chat**. All live chat sessions are recorded and added to the ticket as a transcript.


## Managing Billing 

To view your contracts and monthly billing reports, simply click the **Account** tab in the Box Panel Dashboard, then click the **Billing** tab.

**To become a new customer:**

1. Provide the Blue Box Support team with the billing managerâ€™s name, email, and other contact information associated with your company.
2. After your companyâ€™s billing information is received by the IBM Finance, a contract is created based on your requirements. Every IBM customer has a CFTS (customer fulfillment) account assigned. This information is documented and written on your contract. 
3. A billing start date will be set so that your solution can begin to be billed (typically, the start date is the same as your deployment date, and billing repeats monthly).

Once youâ€™re able to log into Box Panel, you can view your billing information by selecting **Billing** under the **Account** drop-down menu. From here, you can view your **Account Services** and **Billing History**.

By clicking **Billing History**, you can download all of your invoices and save them in PDF format.

For further billing support, please contact the Blue Box Support Team, and we will be happy to assist you.
To add additional line items, such as expansion nodes, to your infrastructure, please contact the Blue Box Support Team. We will create a new monthly contract and help to streamline your setup process in any way that we can.
